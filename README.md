# About
This is a MOS6502 emulator that has all official opcode implemented with cycle count accurate instruction executions.

A big thanks to the One Lone Coder (https://github.com/OneLoneCoder) for its video tutorials that has helped me immensely throughout this project.

There are some TODOS to improve this Emulator:
1. Making sure each cycle's BUS activity is accurate
2. Accurately emulate decimal mode
3. Implementing unofficial OPCODES
